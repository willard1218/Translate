He's 47 years old, slim, spiky hair, describes himself on Twitter as \"movies, TV, technology, tacos.\" And Roy Price has a very responsible job, because it's his responsibility to pick the shows, the original content that Amazon is going to make."

            "english": "And of course that's a highly competitive space. I mean, there are so many TV shows already out there, that Roy can't just choose any show. He has to find shows that are really, really great. So in other words, he has to find shows that are on the very right end of this curve here."

So if your show gets a rating of nine points or higher, that's a winner. Then you have a top two percent show.

            "english": "Now, Roy Price is not worried about getting on the left end of the curve, because I think you would have to have some serious brainpower to undercut \"Toddlers and Tiaras.\" So what he's worried about is this middle bulge here, the bulge of average TV, you know, those shows that aren't really good or really bad, they don't really get you excited.

And so when Amazon is giving out free stuff, you're going to take it, right? So millions of viewers are watching those episodes.

(Audience: \"Alpha House.\") Yes, \"Alpha House,\" but it seems like not too many of you here remember that show, actually, because it didn't turn out that great.

Meanwhile, however, at about the same time, at another company, another executive did manage to land a top show using data analysis, and his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, who is the Chief Content Officer of Netflix, and just like Roy, he's on a constant mission to find that great TV show, and he uses data as well to do that,"

            "english": "except he does it a little bit differently. So instead of holding a competition, what he did -- and his team of course -- was they looked at all the data they already had about Netflix viewers, you know, the ratings they give their shows, the viewing histories, what shows people like, and so on. And then they use that data to discover all of these little bits and pieces about the audience: what kinds of shows they like, what kind of producers, what kind of actors. And once they had all of these pieces together, they took a leap of faith, and they decided to license"

They connect all of these millions of data points, and then it works beautifully for one of them, and it doesn't work for the other one. So why? Because logic kind of tells you that this should be working all the time. I mean, if you're collecting millions of data points on a decision you're going to make, then you should be able to make a pretty good decision. You have 200 years of statistics to rely on."
